Dist-Zilla-Plugins-CJM version 3.02, released November 11, 2010


Dist-Zilla-Plugins-CJM is a collection of plugins I've written for
Dist::Zilla.  The plugins here used to be distributed in
Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-CJM, but when I actually wrote @CJM, I decided
that it had too many prerequisites to be distributed with them.  If
you had previously installed Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-CJM (and you
aren't actually using @CJM), you should uninstall that and just
install this.

I've written some other plugins that are distributed separately,
because they had different prerequisites.  The ones collected here
have fairly simple prerequisites, and I didn't want to have to make
separate distributions for all of them.

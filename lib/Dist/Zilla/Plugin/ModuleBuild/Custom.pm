=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ModuleBuild::Custom - Allow a dist to have a custom Build.PL

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.08 of
Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ModuleBuild::Custom, released May 22, 2010
as part of Dist-Zilla-Plugins-CJM version 3.00.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In F<dist.ini>:

  [ModuleBuild::Custom]
  mb_version = 0.34  ; the default comes from the ModuleBuild plugin

In your F<Build.PL>:

  use Module::Build;

  my $builder = Module::Build->new(
    module_name => 'Foo::Bar',
  ##{ $plugin->get_prereqs ##}
  );
  $builder->create_build_script;

Of course, your F<Build.PL> should be more complex than that, or you
don't need this plugin.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin is for people who need something more complex than the
auto-generated F<Makefile.PL> or F<Build.PL> generated by the
L<MakeMaker|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker> or
L<ModuleBuild|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ModuleBuild> plugins.

It is a subclass of the L<ModuleBuild plugin|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ModuleBuild>,
but it does not write a F<Build.PL> for you.  Instead, you write your
own F<Build.PL>, which may do anything L<Module::Build> is capable of
(except generate a compatibility F<Makefile.PL>).

This plugin will process F<Build.PL> as a template (using
L<Text::Template>), which allows you to add data from Dist::Zilla to
the version you distribute (if you want).  The template delimiters are
C<##{> and C<##}>, because that makes them look like comments.
That makes it easier to have a F<Build.PL> that works both before and
after it is processed as a template.

The template may use the following variables:

=over

=item C<$dist>

The name of the distribution.

=item C<$meta>

The hash of metadata that will be stored in F<META.yml>.

=item C<$plugin>

The ModuleBuild::Custom object that is processing the template.

=item C<$version>

The distribution's version number.

=item C<$zilla>

The Dist::Zilla object that is creating the distribution.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_meta

  $plugin->get_meta(qw(key1 key2 ...))

A template can call this method to extract the specified key(s) from
C<distmeta> and have them formatted into a comma-separated list
suitable for a hash constructor or a method's parameter list.

If any key has no value (or its value is an empty hash or array ref)
it will be omitted from the list.  If all keys are omitted, the empty
string is returned.  Otherwise, the result always ends with a comma.


=head2 get_prereqs

  $plugin->get_prereqs

This is equivalent to

  $plugin->get_meta(qw(build_requires configure_requires requires
                       recommends conflicts))

In other words, it returns all the keys that describe the
distribution's prerequisites.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

ModuleBuild::Custom requires L<Dist::Zilla> (3 or later) and
L<Text::Template>.  I also recommend applying F<Template_strict.patch>
to Text::Template.  This will add support for the STRICT option, which
will help catch errors in your templates.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

You must not use this in conjunction with the
L<ModuleBuild|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ModuleBuild> plugin.
